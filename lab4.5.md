# Lab 4.5: Convert to TypeScript

1. Open a terminal window and create a new project using Vite:

`npm create vite@latest`

2. When vite asks for a name for the project, use react-bookstore-typescript

3. Select react as the framework

4. Select typescript

5. Install the dependencies

`cd react-bookstore-typescript`

`npm install`

6. Copy the App, Header, Main, ProductList, Product, Cart, CartItem, and Footer components, plus your tests, from react-bookstore to react-bookstore-typescript

7. Delete the App.tsx file that was created by Vite

8. Rename Main.jsx to MainContainer.tsx and fix import in App.js

9. Rename your custom components to have .tsx extensions.

10. Enter `npm run dev` to start the development server.
